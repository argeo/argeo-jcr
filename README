Argeo JCR provides extensions of Argeo Commons for use with the Java Content Repository API and Apache Jackrabbit.

Please note that the JCR API is unfortunately provided under a proprietary license (the "Day Sepcification License", cf. https://developer.adobe.com/experience-manager/reference-materials/spec/jcr/2.0/license.html) which is therefore incompatible with this GPL-licensed layer, and that it must be conveyed separately. (This paragraph is not a legal advice)

## Build
Prerequisites to build this layer:
- build Argeo TP
- build Argeo Commons
(cf. http://git.argeo.org)

Then, run:

git clone http://git.argeo.org/gpl/argeo-jcr.git --recursive
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64/
./argeo-jcr/configure

cd argeo-jcr
make clean all

In order to use it within an Eclipse PDE environment:

make clean all manifests

which will copy the generated OSGi MANIFESTs back to the source tree. The *.target files in argeo-tp/sdk can then be used to configure the target platforms.

In order to develop with the Eclipse RCP components (Eclipse RAP being the default), additionally run:

make -f Makefile-rcp.mk manifests
